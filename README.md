# Last Player Standing Game

This is a simple OpenGL game written as part of a computer graphics university course. One player is controlled by keyboard and the rest are controlled by the computer. The goal of the game is to push all other players off the surface.

Written in 2012 in Java using JOGL 1.1.1 and jogl-utils. Dependencies and game assets (textures, sounds, etc.) are not included at this point.
